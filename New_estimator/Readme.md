# Readme for this folder for experimenting on VAR data comparing different variance estimation methods

# The output of the bias generated from each method (Batch means, Lugsail Batch Means, weighted batch means and cc(new)) at different chain lengths are saved in the "bias_data.Rdata" file generated from "VAR_bias_output.R".

# For visual representation the obtained biases are duly plotted in "plot_bias.pdf" generated by "VAR_bias_plot.R".

# The "Cov_func.R" is for funtion construction of the new estimator.

# The "VAR_func.R" creates functions for data generation and True sigma calculation.

#"VAR_bias.R" creates functions for computing biases.
